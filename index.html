					<h4>October 15, 2023</h4>
			<p class="intro"> Summonses for quality-of-life crimes, including drinking in public, have soared in the last year in Elmhurst and Jackson Heights.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Police Department officials, at a Queens Community District 3 board meeting last month, announced the surge while also highlighting an uptick in crimes like robberies and auto theft. Arrests are up 30 percent for the year. 
				</p>
			<p>“Quality-of-life summonses are up 900 percent for the year with everything going on along Roosevelt Avenue,” said Lt. Christopher Colon at the meeting, suggesting that the increase in summonses for minor offenses was tied to the Queens avenue notorious for brothels.</p>
			<p>The 110th Precinct in Corona and Elmhurst and the 115th Precincts in Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst are first and third citywide respectively since the beginning of the year for the numbers of summonses issued for drinking in public and public urination, the two most common quality-of- life summonses issued, according to data on OpenData NYC. 
				At a separate Woodhaven town hall on public safety in September, the NYPD chief of department, Jeffrey Maddrey, stressed balance when enforcing quality-of-life crimes.
				</p>
			<p>“I don’t want my officers giving a summons to a hard-working person,” he said.</p>
			<p>But the summons data show that some neighborhoods, and some demographics, are being issued more summonses than others - by a lot.</p>
			<p>The overwhelming majority of people issued summons for drinking in public across Elmhurst and Jackson Heights are Hispanic. More than 1,400 drinking or urinating summonses were issued to Hispanc people in those neighborhoods, while only 28 were issued to white people. 
				Census data shows about 57,000 Hispanic people and about 20,000 white people live in Jackson Heights. In 2022, 832 summonses, for the two categories, were issued across the two precincts.
				</p>
			<p>The data reflect a return to “precision policing” in New York City. Mayor Eric Adams became mayor  in the wake of state- and citywide police reform.  </p>
			<p>Under his predecessor, Bill de Blasio, the NYPD moved away from “broken windows” policing. </p>
			<p>But the statistics in Jackson Heights suggest that the department is again focusing on low-level arrests.</p>
			<p>Adams praised precision policing in September.</p>
			<p>“It’s going to be a hallmark of our administration,” he said.</p>
			<p>Quality-of-life summonses, part of precision policing efforts, are intended to be used as a crime and violence prevention strategy, said Peter Moskos, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who is the director of the NYPD executive masters leadership program.
			</p>
			<p>Precision policing, he suggested, is broken windows policing in a new guise. “None of this is new, it’s just repackaged,” he said. </p>
			<p>“Police are policing again.” </p>
			<p>Moskos stressed the need for discretion and nuance when conducting quality-of-life policing. The end goal is not to harass communities, but to target known criminals, he said. </p>
			<p>But critics of the policy question its effectiveness. “There’s no evidence that broken windows policing, specifically the policing of low-level issues, actually leads to drops in crime,” said Dr. Dan O’Brien, a professor at Northeastern University. Engaging in low-level offenses, like drinking in public, is unlikely to compel someone to commit crimes in the future, he said.</p>
			<p>Residents at the meeting said the quality-of-life summonses aren’t addressing their chief concerns — like prostitution and trash.</p>
			<p>Frank Taylor, chair of the community board, said brothels are proliferating in the neighborhood.</p>
			<p>“We have 250 of them,” he said . Colon said 12 brothels are slated for closure but said no  arrests have been made in connection with prostitution.</p>
			<p>Angela Coyne, a longtime Jackson Heights resident, cited trash more than public drinking or prostitution as a problem in the neighborhood.“Cleaning the streets would lower crime, if there is crime,” she said.</p>
